# FaveFinds App

## Problem Statement
Have you ever seen your favorite social media influencers receive packages from brands, and wondered what they do with all that stuff? What if there was a platform where they could sell the items they no longer need or want to their followers
Allow me to introduce FaveFinds, a Power Platform Canvas App designed to help influencers declutter their homes while offering their followers the opportunity to benefit from competitive pricing through bidding

## Technologies Used
* **Power Apps:** FaveFinds leverages Power Apps to create a user-friendly and visually appealing interface which showcases the items that influencers are selling.
* **Sharepoint:** 
FaveFinds uses SharePoint as its data storage system. This allows for seamless integration of data handling.
* **Power Apps CoPilot:** FaveFinds app development was expedited and simplified with the assistance of Power Apps CoPilot. By describing the specific components of the app I wished to create, Power Apps CoPilot automatically generated them.
* **CoPilot Chatbot in PowerApps:** This chatbot enables customers to check the availability of desired items and further refine their search to discover items sold by influencers from various demographics, including those who are underrepresented.

## What Solution Does This App Offer?
* **For social media influencers:** A platform to sell unwanted or gifted items to their followers. This can help influencers to declutter their homes and closets, and to make extra money from items that they no longer need or want.
* **For consumers:** The app provides a way to purchase high-quality, often-new items at a discounted price and discover new brands and products that they may not be aware of otherwise.
* **Enhanced User Experience:** The app is easy to use making the shopping process faster and easier, and it makes the app more enjoyable to use.
* **Diversity and Inclusion:** FaveFinds promotes diversity and inclusion in influencer marketing. By featuring influencers from underrepresented demographics, the app contributes to a more inclusive and representative online marketplace.
* **Personalized Shopping:** The app allows users to align their shopping experiences with their values and interests. By finding influencers who align with their demographic or style, users can make more informed purchasing decisions.

## Future Enhancements

* Incorporate a log in screen for both the influncers and consumers
